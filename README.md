# Data Mining Project: Parkinson's Disease

## Introduction

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement. This project employs data mining techniques to analyze large datasets to identify patterns, predict disease progression, and aid in early diagnosis.

## Objectives

- **Early Detection**: Identify early signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease from patient data.
- **Prediction of Disease Progression**: Use historical data to predict the progression of the disease.
- **Patient Classification**: Classify patients into different stages of the disease.
- **Symptom Correlation**: Find correlations between different symptoms and the progression of the disease.

## Data Collection

The data for this project is sourced from:
- **Public Datasets**: Such as the Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- **Medical Records**: Patient medical records containing information on symptoms, treatments, and progression.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, noise reduction, and removing outliers.
2. **Normalization**: Standardizing the data to a common scale.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying and selecting relevant features for the analysis.

## Data Mining Techniques

1. **Classification**: Using algorithms like Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks to classify patients based on disease stage.
2. **Clustering**: Grouping patients with similar symptoms and disease progression patterns using K-means or Hierarchical Clustering.
3. **Association Rule Mining**: Identifying patterns and associations between different symptoms and disease stages.

## Implementation

### Software and Tools

- **Python**: For data preprocessing, visualization, and implementation of data mining algorithms.

### Libraries

- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Results and Discussion

- **Accuracy of Models**: Evaluate the accuracy of different classification models in predicting disease stages.
- **Important Features**: Identify which features (symptoms, age, etc.) are most predictive of disease progression.
- **Clusters Analysis**: Interpret the clusters formed and their relevance to different stages of Parkinson's disease.

## Conclusion

Data mining provides valuable insights into the early detection and progression of Parkinson's disease. By analyzing large datasets, healthcare professionals can make more informed decisions and improve patient outcomes.
